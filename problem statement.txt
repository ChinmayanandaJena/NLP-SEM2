Goal :
The objective of this hackathon is to show case your Natural language Processing  skills leveraging product review datasets to develop a  binary classification model for predicting the rating of online product based on its reviews.
This predictive model broadly will be used as a sentiment analysis model.

Metric to measure :
        The Metric  will be F1 -Score  .

The predicted Rating for each review in the test dataset will be compared with the actual Rating to calculate the F1 -Score  of the entire prediction. The higher the F1-score, the better the model will be.
